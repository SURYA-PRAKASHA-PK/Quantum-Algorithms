Quantum Teleportation:
Quantum teleportation is a groundbreaking protocol in quantum information theory that enables the transfer of quantum information between two qubits, even when they are spatially separated. This process is achieved through the clever use of quantum entanglement and classical communication. Here's a concise overview of the quantum teleportation process:

Overview:
Quantum teleportation involves three qubits - the sender's qubit to be teleported (|ψ⟩), an entangled qubit pair shared between the sender and receiver (|Φ+⟩), and the receiver's qubit. The teleportation process consists of the following steps:

Initialization:
The sender prepares the entangled pair in an initial state |Φ+⟩.
The sender applies a quantum gate (X gate) to the qubit to be teleported (|ψ⟩), preparing it in the desired state.

Entanglement:
The sender performs a series of quantum operations (Hadamard and CNOT gates) to create entanglement between the qubit to be teleported and the entangled pair.

Bell Measurement:
A Bell measurement is performed on the sender's two qubits (the qubit to be teleported and the entangled qubit). This measurement yields two classical bits.

Classical Communication:
The measurement outcomes are communicated to the receiver using classical communication.

Correction:
Based on the communicated results, the receiver applies quantum gates (X and Z gates) to correct the state of the receiver's qubit.

Verification:
The receiver now possesses the teleported state (|ψ⟩), and the sender's state is effectively transferred.

Simulation Results:
The simulation results provide insights into the outcomes of the quantum teleportation protocol. The possible results include various binary outcomes, each corresponding to a possible state of the teleported qubit.
