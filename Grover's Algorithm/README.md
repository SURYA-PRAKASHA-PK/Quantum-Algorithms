Grover's Algorithm for Two Qubits
Introduction:

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm renowned for its ability to search unsorted databases efficiently. While classical algorithms have a time complexity of O(n) for this task, Grover's algorithm achieves O(sqrt(n)) in the quantum realm, where n is the number of objects in the set.

Implementation Overview:
This example utilizes the Qiskit framework for quantum computing to implement Grover's algorithm for a two-qubit system. The key components are the creation of an oracle and a reflection, applied iteratively to converge to the desired state |w>.

Steps to Run the Code
Oracle Creation:

An oracle function oc is formed, executing a controlled-Z gate between two qubits.
The oracle is transformed into a gate and incorporated into the quantum circuit.

Reflection Creation:
A reflection circuit ref is crafted, involving Hadamard gates, a Pauli-X gate, and a controlled-Z gate.
The reflection is converted into a gate for circuit integration.

Applying Oracle and Reflection Iteratively:
The quantum circuit gc is initialized with Hadamard gates and updated with the oracle and reflection gates in an iterative fashion.

Measurement:
The final quantum circuit is measured, and the outcomes are obtained using a quantum simulator.

Execution and Results:
The quantum circuit is executed on the simulator, yielding measurement results indicative of the algorithm's success in reaching the desired state |w>.

Outcome
In the provided example, the output is {'11': 1}, signifying that the algorithm effectively reached the state |11>, corresponding to the target state |w>.
