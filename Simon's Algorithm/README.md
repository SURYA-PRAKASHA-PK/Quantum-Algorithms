Simon's Algorithm Implementation

Overview

Simon's algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed to solve a specific type of problem more efficiently than classical algorithms. In this implementation, we'll walk through the steps of Simon's algorithm using the Qiskit framework.

Algorithm Description:

Simon's algorithm aims to find a hidden binary string cc(secret code) given an oracle that computes a function f(x) where f(x) = f(y) if and only if y = x âŠ• cc for some non-zero cc. The goal is to determine the hidden binary string cc with fewer queries than classical algorithms.

Implementation Steps:

Oracle Construction:

A quantum circuit is created to implement the oracle based on the secret code cc.
The oracle is designed to be efficient for the problem at hand.

Simon's Algorithm Circuit:

A Simon's algorithm circuit is initialized with Hadamard gates on n qubits.
The oracle circuit is integrated into the Simon's algorithm circuit.

Hadamard Transformation:

Additional Hadamard gates are applied to the qubits.
Measurements are added to observe the final output.

Simulation and Results:

The circuit is executed on a quantum simulator.
The results, representing possible solutions, are visualized using a histogram.
